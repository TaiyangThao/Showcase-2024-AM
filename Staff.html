        <p>
            Hello, I'm Taiyang, and I bring over 23
            years of invaluable experience in the field
            of Information Technology. My journey in IT 
            has been nothing short of exciting, and I've 
            had the privilege of working with industry
            leaders, including Google. Other than IT, I 
            specialize in game design with 5+ years.
            Some well known companies I work for
            includes, Nintendo and Epic Games.
        </p>

            Michael is a 3D graphics designer, I worked with Unity for 5 years. I was 18 years old when I started working in the technology industry.
             I was inspired by how websites and software designs are made and decided to give it a try. 
            At 20 I worked with Unity which introduced me to games and 3D design.
